# lib
This repository contains the code of the shared feature encoding component for the [Release Engineering for Machine Learning Application](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/remla/) course of the TU Delft.
It purpose is to have a common preprocessor between a [training pipeline](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-training) and a [machine learning model](https://github.com/remla23-team13/model-service) used in production,
in such a way that they will preprocess the data in the same way to obtain consistent results.
# Installation
The library can be installed with pip:
```
pip install remlalib
```
